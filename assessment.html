							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>This scenario draws inspiration from an authentic assessment experience. However, for academic purposes, I am compelled to reframe it to maintain scholarly integrity.</p>
							<h2>Lab</h2>
							<p>To prepare for assessment, I've set up a virtual environment with two VMs deployed in VMware Workstation. One VM runs Metasploitable 2, while the other runs Kali Linux. Alongside the preinstalled tools in Kali, I've also installed ZAP and OpenVAS for additional capabilities. </p>
							<h2>Scenario</h2>
							<p>SteelCraft Innovations Ltd company has enlisted your services to perform a penetration test with a primary focus on their web server. This server manages client requests and hosts a legacy application responsible for processing sensitive information regarding orders, billing, and customer accounts. The company's paramount concern is guaranteeing the security and integrity of this web server to shield against potential threats and uphold the confidentiality of their clients' data. The legacy application, which remains on-premises due to its incompatibility with modern cloud solutions, presents a unique challenge. While the management is actively seeking a replacement for the application, securing it in the interim is imperative.</p>
							<h2>Assessment requirements</h2>
							<p>Your objective is to create a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating your proficiency in cybersecurity concepts and practices. This portfolio should feature a penetration testing report focused on a designated target system provided via a virtual machine (VM). The report should adhere to the P.A.S.T.A Methodology and encompass the following key sections:</p>
							<p>Reconnaissance, Threat Modelling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Results Analysis, Report & Remediation Advice   </p>
							<p>Additionally, the portfolio should include a summary discussing ethical and legal considerations relevant to the case study. It should address potential challenges associated with remotely searching a target computer while operating within the framework of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA).</p>
